# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!
This repository contains a **Streamlit-based communication system visualization app**.
Contributions should improve correctness, clarity, performance, or educational value.

---

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Raise an Issue

Before writing any code:

* Open a GitHub Issue
* Clearly describe the bug, feature, or improvement
* Add screenshots, references, or examples if relevant
* Suggest a possible technical approach (optional but recommended)

**Direct PRs without an issue are not accepted** (except trivial fixes like typos or docs formatting).

---

### 2. Get the Issue Claimed

* Comment on the issue to request assignment
* Maintainer will assign the issue
* Only one contributor per issue (to prevent duplicate work)

---

### 3. Create a Branch

Create a new branch from `main`:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/issue-<id>-short-name
git checkout -b fix/issue-<id>-short-name
```

Example:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/issue-12-qpsk-visualization
```

---

### 4. Develop Locally

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Follow existing project structure and coding style.
Keep changes minimal and scoped to the issue.

---

### 5. Create a Pull Request (PR)

When ready:

* Push your branch
* Open a PR to `main`
* Reference the issue number in the PR title or description

Example:

```
Fix: QPSK constellation scaling (#12)
```

---

## Contribution Rules

* One issue → one PR
* No unrelated changes in the same PR
* Code must run locally without errors
* Visualizations must be technically correct
* No broken UI flows

---

## What You Can Contribute

* New Features visualizations
* Notes in Existing Modules
* UI/UX improvements
* Performance optimizations
* Documentation
* Educational explanations

---

## Code Quality Standards

* Clear variable naming
* Modular functions
* No hardcoded constants without explanation
* Reusable components
* No dead code

---

## Maintainer Rights

Maintainers may:

* Reject low-quality PRs
* Request changes
* Close inactive issues
* Reassign abandoned issues

---

## Philosophy

This project prioritizes:

* Technical correctness
* Educational value
* Clean architecture
* Simplicity over complexity

If it doesn’t improve learning, correctness, or usability — it doesn’t belong here.
